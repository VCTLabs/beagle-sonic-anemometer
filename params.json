For now, this will suffice.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Status Update 27/6\r\n+ PRU Firmware\r\n   * Basic first pass done, no testing on actual THS1206 yet\r\n      - Basic initialization/reset\r\n      - Read values as it is available\r\n      - Store values in local RAM\r\n      - Transfer data to ARM with RPMsg using character device (or at least trying)\r\n   * TODO\r\n      - Get data transfer working\r\n      - More extensive configuration\r\n      - Tx triggers\r\n      - Synchronization (can just be a flag in a shared register)\r\n      - Actual hardware testing\r\n+ Other sensors\r\n   * TODO\r\n      - Get existing libs working on my board (works for mentors)\r\n      - Look into using kernel modules where available\r\n      - Check out options like MAVLink\r\n+ Sensor Fusion\r\n   * TODO\r\n      - Pulse detection from ADC results\r\n      - Calculate speed of sound\r\n\r\nThe way forward from here seems pretty clear.\r\n+ RPMsg stuff shouldn't bet too bad, I probably just need to start from a very small/simple example (like one from the pru-support-package, which does work for me) and build it up to what I need.\r\n+ Getting the other sensors working is a bit of an unknown, but it is certainly just a local problem.\r\n+ Fleshing out the PRU firmware should be relatively straightforward. It's mostly a matter of twiddling the right bits for initialization. The rest is just adding a few basic checks and loops on top of existing code.\r\n+ First major unknown will be getting the firmware to actually properly control the THS1206 for real. Unfortunately I don't have a scope, so I'll probably need to go find one.\r\n+ Second major unknown will be the pulse detection. The goal here is relatively simple, but the complexity is going to depend a lot on what actually comes out of the hardware.",
